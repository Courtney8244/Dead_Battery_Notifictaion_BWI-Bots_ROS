# Dead_Battery_Notifictaion_BWI-Bots_ROS
The robot's battery gets drained throughout the day and when it finally dies it shuts down at that position. 
No message gets sent out on its whereabouts and the UT Robotics staff has to go search for it. 
This project notified the UT Robotics staff when the BWI-Bot has a low battery percentage.
