# Dead_Battery_Notifictaion_BWI-Bots_ROS
The robots battery gets drained throughout the day and when it finally dies it shuts down at that position. 
No message gets sent out on its whereabouts and the UT Robotics staff has to go serach for it. 
This project notified the UT Robtics staff when the BWI-Bot has a low battery percentage.
